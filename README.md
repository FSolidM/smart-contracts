# SmartContracts

## Quick Start
First, install the following:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v4.x.x recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Then, clone the `smart contracts` repository and install packages with npm:
```
npm install
npm instal webgme
```
Start mongodb locally by running the `mongod` executable in your mongodb installation (you may need to create a `data` directory or set `--dbpath`).

Start the server locally
```
npm start
```
After the webgme server is up and there are no error messages in the console, open a valid address in the browser to start using SmartContracts. The default is http://127.0.0.1:8888/, you should see all valid addresses in the console.
